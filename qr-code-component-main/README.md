## My process

### What I learned

I learned the basics of how to use a flex container, but I still struggle with centering items vertically.

```css
.container {
  height: 96vh;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I definitely need to sharpen my HTML and CSS toolset, but specifically, the use of FlexBox, custom fonts, and margins.
